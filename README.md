===========================

Judged in top 10 best under 20 lines JavaScript code hack on Challengepost(Now DevPost), its a code downloader to be used to download personal submissions on Ideone for backup purpose.

## Why this?
Because Ideone APIs don't allow us to download all the codes at once.

## How to use?
1. Copy the code from ConsoleCode.js and paste it in your Browser's Console. You can open it by pressing CTRL+Shift+J. Press Enter.
1. After running the script and closing the newly opened browser windows you might have to go to your downloads area in your browser and press allow to download if it is a python file.
